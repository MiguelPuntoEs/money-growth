# Money Growth

This repository aims to discover money growth influence on inflation. In order achieve that goal several Jupyter notebooks were developed:

1. Gather relevant economic information (`data-preparation.ipynb`): nominal GDP, broad money aggregates (M3, M4x) and inflation (CPI).
2. Process the data to describe money velocity behavior, model it and model inflation with a Markov-switching model dependent on present and past nominal GDP, broad money aggregates and money velocity changes (`money-growth.ipynb`).
